# Wifi Stats Checker

Using this site, you can check current wifi usage at buildings across UC Davis and compare it to historical data. At the moment, the historical data covers the last 7 months. Each building has data for each 10-minute interval of the week, which should accurately reflect average usage for most cases. This project was made for HackDavis 2019.
